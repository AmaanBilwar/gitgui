## Git GUI until i figure out a better name 

this a gui application for me to learn [rust]([text](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)) and [tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) to make a gui application for the most commonly used git commands by me


### most commonly used commands i think?

- create:
    - repo 
    - issue 
    - pr 
    - branch / includes checkout 
    
- review: 
    - pr

- delete:
    - branch 

- view: 
    - status

### libs
